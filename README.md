# Terraform AWS Labels


We are a group of DevOps engineers & architects, joining hands in this ever evolving digital landscape. With our strong belief in Automation; just like microservices, always on the lookout to split the the infrastructure into smaller connected resources (database, cluster and more) which could be standardized, are manageable, scalable, secure & follow industry best practices. 


This module includes Terraform open source, examples, and automation tests (for better understanding), which would help you create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic coding.
